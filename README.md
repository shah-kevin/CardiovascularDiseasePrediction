# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction
# Upload to Consolidating all projects on GitHub

This Repo has the python notebook that Runs Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

- Cardiovascular disease : Narrowing of blood vessels leading to heart attack, chest pain or stroke. 
- Factors Affecting Heart Condition : Age, Height, Cholesterol, Blood Pressure etc.
- It is important to learn about risk factors for heart disease, so that one can educate themselves.
This Project studies different risk factors and how these factors affects the possibility of cardiovascular disease.

- To Predict the possibility of Cardiovascular disease, we have taken dataset from Kaggle.
 - The dataset consist of 12 feature and 70000 records.
- There are 3 types of input features:
     1. Objective: factual information;
     2. Examination: results of medical examination;
     3. Subjective: information given by the patient.

Cleaning Performed:
Detecting Missing values.
Detecting wrong or incorrect values.
Identifying Outliers.

Library Used: sklearn
Models Ran: 
1) Random Forest Classifier
2) Logistic Regression
3) Decision Tree
4) Naive Bayes
5) KNN
   

Results:
- The top risk factors for cardiovascular diseases are: age , cholesterol, weight, glucose.
- We have predicted the possibility of cardiovascular disease using Random Forest Algorithm Logistic Regression , Decision Tree, Na√Øve Bayes, and Kneighbors.
- The accuracy score for Logistic Regression is highest.
- Logistic Regression Algorithm is the best fitted model.
